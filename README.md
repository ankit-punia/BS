# Book Shop Project

## Input/Output
### Input
[book.cpp lines 30-43](/book.cpp)
</br>I created a getBookDetail() function which is used to take input when the user want to add the book in the store.
### Output
[book.cpp lines 220-229](/book.cpp)
 </br>I created a displayBooks() function which is used to display all the book details in formatted output.

## Control Flow
### if
[main.cpp lines 9-10](/main.cpp)
</br>I created a matrix variable (vector of vector of pixels) to represent an image because images are two-dimensional
grids of Red-Green-Blue pixel components.
  
### else if
[main.cpp lines 9-10](/main.cpp)
</br>I created a matrix variable (vector of vector of pixels) to represent an image because images are two-dimensional grids of Red-Green-Blue pixel components.
  
### else
[main.cpp lines 9-10](/main.cpp)
</br>I created a matrix variable (vector of vector of pixels) to represent an image because images are two-dimensional grids of Red-Green-Blue pixel components.
